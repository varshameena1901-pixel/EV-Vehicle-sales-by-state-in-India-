# EV-Vehicle-sales-by-state-in-India-
Analysis of Electric Vehicle (EV) sales across India to identify trends, top-performing states, and popular EV categories.
A complete Data Analysis project exploring EV sales trends across Indian states using Python, Pandas, and Data Visualization techniques.

📌 Project Overview:-

  This project analyzes Electric Vehicle (EV) sales data across different states of India.
  It includes data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and key insights about EV adoption patterns.

🗂 Dataset:-

  File: Electric Vehicle Sales by State in India.csv
  The dataset contains:

  1). Year

  2). Month_Name

  3). Date

  4). State

  5).Vehicle_Class

  6). Vehicle_Category

  7). Vehicle_Type

  8). EV_Sales_Quantity

  The dataset is already cleaned (no missing values).

🔧 Technologies Used:- 

   1). Python

   2). Pandas

   3). NumPy

  4). Matplotlib

  5). Seaborn

  6).Jupyter Notebook

🧹 Data Preprocessing:-

Key preprocessing steps:

  -- Converted Year to integer

  -- Converted Date to datetime format

  -- Categorized non-numerical columns

  -- Checked duplicates and missing values

  -- Basic data understanding and statistics

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizations include:

  -- Yearly EV sales trend

  -- Monthly sales trend

  -- State-wise EV sales

  -- Sales by Vehicle Class

  -- Sales by Vehicle Category

  -- Sales by Vehicle Type

📌 Key Insights

  -- EV sales increased sharply after 2019.

  -- 2022–2023 recorded the highest EV sales.

  -- Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh are the top-performing states.

  -- 2-wheelers dominate India's EV market (largest share).

  -- 3-wheelers (e-rickshaws) also show strong adoption.

🏁 Conclusion

  -- EV adoption in India is growing rapidly.
  -- High-performing states show strong infrastructure and awareness, while most EV growth is driven by 2-wheelers and commercial 3-wheelers.
